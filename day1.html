        <h3>Process of making chili paneer</h3>
        <p><b>FOR FRYING THE PANEER:</b><br>
            In a bowl, add flour, corn starch, salt, water little by little (approx 3 tbsp), and mix to form a batter that is not too thick or thin. Toss paneer cubes in this batter.
            
            Heat oil in a pan for frying on medium flame. Once the oil is hot, add paneer cubes and fry until the batter turns crispy and golden brown. In total, it takes about 4 minutes of frying. Transfer it to a paper towel to absorb excess oil. Keep this aside. <br>
            <b>MAKING OF CHILLI PANEER:</b><br>
            In a pan on medium heat, add oil. Once hot, add dry red chilies and saute for 30 seconds. Add garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add ginger and saute for a few more seconds.
            
            Now add onions, turn the flame to high and saute for a minute. Add capsicum and continue to saute for another 30 seconds. Add 1 tablespoon of green chili paste (store-bought or prepared above), green onions, salt, sugar, and mix.
            
            Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon of cornflour in a bowl with Â½ cup of water and mix to form a slurry.
            Add this slurry to the dish along with soy sauce and toss to combine and cook till the gravy thickens - it takes about a minute.

            Finally, add fried paneer and cook for two minutes so that they are heated through. Garnish with some more spring onions, coriander leaves, and toss to combine.</p>

            <h3>TIPS:</h3>
            <ul>
<li>Paneer can be shallow fried in a pan, grilled in oven or bbq, or deep-fried. I have shallow fried.</li>
<li>Don't fry the paneer for a long time as it will make the paneer hard and chewy. Total fry time should be between 2 to 4 minutes.</li>

<li> the sauces and spices to your taste.</li>
<li>Do not add too much cornflour, as this will make your dish starchy and spoil the taste.</li>
</ul>

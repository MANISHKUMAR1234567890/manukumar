        <h3>Process of making momos:</h3>
        <p><b> Prepare the dough:
            :
        </b><br>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and a pinch of salt.
Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth and soft dough.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.

         <br>
            <b>Prepare the filling:

                
                </b><br>
                
                In a mixing bowl, combine the ground meat or tofu with chopped onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, and cabbage.
Add soy sauce, sesame oil (if using), salt, and black pepper. Mix well.
Lastly, add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves and mix again.

   <br>
   <b>Shape the momos:

</b>

After the dough has rested, knead it again for a few minutes.
Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls.
Roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 3-4 inches in diameter.
<br>

<b>Fill and shape the momos:
</b>
Place a spoonful of the prepared filling in the center of each dough circle.
To shape the momo, fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape.
Pleat and pinch the edges together to seal the momo. You can use water to help seal the edges if needed.
Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. <br>

<b>Steam the momos:
</b>
Once all the momos are shaped, place them in a greased steamer basket or on a greased steamer tray.
Steam the momos for about 10-12 minutes or until the dough is cooked and the filling is cooked through.
<br>

<b> Serve:
</b>Serve hot momos with a dipping sauce made of soy sauce mixed with a dash of vinegar, chopped chilies, and minced garlic.
